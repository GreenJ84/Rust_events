/// Defines the contract for event-driven types that manage listeners and emit events.
///
/// This trait provides a flexible, extensible API for adding, removing, and querying listeners, as well as emitting events both synchronously and asynchronously.
/// Implementors can be used as event-driven components in any application, and users may implement their own custom event handlers by conforming to this trait.
///
/// # Type Parameters
/// * `T`: The payload type for events. Must be `Send + Sync`.
///
/// # Thread Safety
/// All implementors must be `Send + Sync`.
